          <p>The provisions of these General Terms and Conditions define the conditions of the method of ordering, rights of access, prices and rights and obligations applicable to all Provider's services and deliveries, for which the Buyer submits an order. According to the specificity of each individual service, in addition to these General Terms and Conditions, Special Terms and Conditions may also apply (a separate document not constituting an integral part of the General Terms and Conditions), which are presented to the client upon ordering an individual service to which these Special Terms and Conditions apply. These Special Terms and Conditions are binding for the Buyer and constitute an integral part of the agreement between the Provider and the Buyer.</p>

          <p>The General Terms and Conditions also apply to users using the services on the basis of the agreement or other relationship with a third party who is not the Provider and has signed an agreement with the Provider, on the basis of which the Provider confers the right on the respective third party to grant the right to its clients to use the services. By accepting these General Terms and Conditions or using the services, there is no contractual relationship established between the Provider and these users. Nevertheless, the users are obligated to follow the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions. In the case of any discrepancies between the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions and the agreement concluded between the third party and the user, the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions shall apply.</p>

          <p>The Buyer is notified of and agrees with the fact that in terms of specific services and deliveries it is, in addition to these General Terms and Conditions, also bound by the General Terms and Conditions or contractual provisions of third parties. By using the services, the Buyer confirms that it fully accepts the provisions of the General Terms and Conditions or contractual provisions of third parties. Upon submitting the order, i.e. prior to the use of service, the Buyer notes the use of General Terms and Conditions or contractual provisions. In the foregoing cases, the Provider is in no case responsible for the actions of third parties in their relationship to the Buyer or User.</p>

          <p>The provisions of these General Terms and Conditions apply to all buyers, notwithstanding whether they are legal or natural persons.</p>

          <p>By using the Provider's services or visiting or using the website http://xaurum.org/, the Buyer (or User) confirms that it is fully acquainted with the contents of these General Terms and Conditions, that it has been fully and clearly notified of the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions and that it accepts them in full.</p>

          <p>The provisions of these General Terms and Conditions are an integral part of the contractual relationship related to the use of services between the Buyer and the Provider, and apply directly.</p>

          <p>The price list of the Provider's services is an integral part of these General Terms and Conditions and is available on the website http://xaurum.org/ (hereinafter referred to as: price list). By accepting the General Terms and Conditions, the Buyer confirms that it is fully acquainted with the price list. The prices of services are calculated as per the price list applicable on the day of the performed service or delivery.</p>

          <p>The Provider reserves the right to change any of the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions and/or price list at any time and without prior notice. The need to change the provision occurs with the amendments of the legislation, a change of technical conditions, etc., whereby the pricing on the basis of the predetermined formula for services is not deemed as a change to the price list. However, the change of the pricing formula is deemed as a change to the price list.</p>

          <p>The Buyer is obligated to publish the change to any provision of these General Terms and Conditions and/or the price list on its public portals. Since the Provider does not and cannot monitor current Xaurum ownership structure, it is hereby recommended to all current owners of Xaurums to follow any potential changes in the General Terms and Conditions. As per the first paragraph of Article 43.č of the Consumer Protection Act, the Provider shall not provide a remote withdrawal from the agreement.</p>

          <p>If the Buyer or owner of Xaurums does not agree with a change to the General Terms and Conditions, it may sell its Xaurums in the market or exchange them for gold as per the currently applicable price list.</p>

          <p>A change of these General Terms and Conditions is binding on the Buyer if it continues to use the website and/or services or, if it does not withdraw from the contractual relationship with the Provider within 15 days of the receipt of notification. In this case it is deemed that the change binds the Buyer as of the day of the receipt of notification via e-mail.</p>

          <p>The price of services and deliveries is formed on a daily basis as per the formula for an individual submitted order published in the price list. The price is not fixed, but it constantly changes, particularly in relation to the factors of market conditions, whereas the formula itself is unchangeable regarding the currently applicable formula published in the price list and thus provides the specific method to calculate the price. All submitted orders are calculated in the virtual currency – Xaurum (XAUR).</p>

          <p>The payment for services and deliveries is calculated with regard to an individual ordered service or delivery from the relationship between the Buyer and the Provider. The order is verified first, and then the acceptance of the order and the verification are sent to the Buyer. The Buyer performs the transfer in the currency and states the amount of cash in dollars to be exchanged for virtual currency Xaurum (XAUR). By confirming/verifying the order, the Provider prepares the mint for the Buyer and notifies it about an approximate price or how much money the Buyer shall receive in the virtual currency, the value of which is constantly fluctuating and cannot be fixed, and is thus calculated using the formula published in the price list.</p>

          <p>The Buyer pays a desired amount in the currency that is currently accepted by the Provider, and after the purchase of Xaurums, the Provider transfers to the Buyer its Xaurums to the submitted public cryptographic key as per the procedure described in the first paragraph of this Article.</p>

          <p>The Buyer explicitly and unconditionally confirms its responsibility for suitable information before the execution or ordering of any services or deliveries with the Provider.

          <p>The Buyer performs remittance transfers to buy virtual currency Xaurum via the bank account stated in the agreement or order.
